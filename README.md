# spark

Welcome to the spark world !! 

In this repository you can find help with various pyspark code. 

real-time-nlp -> It's a code capable of reading the data from twitter and doing sentiment analysis. 
I have used kafka for real-time streaming, pyspark for processing the data and calculating the sentiment as per tweet. 

market-api -> This project was to get hands on consuming the data realtime and plotting the graph as per realtime data. 
Using yahoo finance and matlab for the same. 

For any queries feel free to comment.
